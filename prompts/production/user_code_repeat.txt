The precondition of the code you generated did not pass the following test case:

[Current Task] {task}

[Current Location] {current_location}

[Spatial Knowledge]
{spatial_knowledge}

[Object Knowledge]
{object_knowledge}

[Previous Tasks]
{previous_tasks}

[Expected Return of `{error_function}()`]
{expected_return}

[Your Code Return]
{code_message}

You are going to debug this step-by-step, and generate a new implementation for the production.

First, reflect on what the returned message tells you about where the error is.

Next, identify what the error is.
Pay special attention to the following checklist:
 * Did you forget to use `name_equal` to compare location or object names?
 * Did you forget to set the variable bindings?
 * Is there a problem with how you generate variable bindings?
 * Is there a mismatch between your code and the provided interface? Is there something wrong with your preview response?

Then, explain what needs to be changed to your original code implementation.

Finally, generate a new implementation for the production above.

Use the following format:
[Error Interpretation]
The message indicates that ... has failed.

[Error attribution]
The error is because ...

[Things to change]
The ... test should be ...

[Python Implementation]
```py
<Your New Code Here>
