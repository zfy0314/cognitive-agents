Refine your response above. Think about the following questions:
 * Is there any relevant information that is not necessary?
 * Is there any crucial relevant information left out of the production?
 * Can you remove part of the precondition to make the production rule less constraining but still effective?
 * Can you further generalize the components in the production rule?

Generate your refined response in the same format as specified above. If you are satisfied with the existing response just copy everything without changing.
