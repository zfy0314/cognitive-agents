The robot is providing you with the following information

[Current Task] {task}

[Current Location] in front of {current_location}

[Spatial Knowledge]
{spatial_knowledge}

[Object Knowledge]
{object_knowledge}

Note that each object has exactly one unique category. There is no multi-purpose tool in the environment. Assume the robot has perfect object recognition accuracy.

[Previous Tasks]
{previous_tasks}

[Action History]
{action_history}

[Existing Plan]
{plan}

[Possible Options]
{possible_actions}

[Blacklisted Options]
{discouraged_actions}

Notes: 
 * Some of the possible options are parametrized, you have to replace "<receptacle>" with the name or type of a receptacle object listed in the spatial knowledge, and replace "<object>" with the name or type of an object.
 * Reuse existing subtasks as much as possible. You don't have to think about the preconditions of the subtasks. If they are on the list, you may assume they are applicable.
 * Do not perform the 'done' action or the 'quit' unless you are absolutely certain the task has been completed or cannot be completed.
 * Moving to a location that has already been explored will not lead to any new information.
 * A container receptacle (e.g. Fridge, Cabinet) has to be opened to be fully explored.
 * An object with a 'sliced' attribute is already fully sliced, and cannot be sliced further.

You will approach the current situation step-by-step and suggest an option for the robot to take in the end.

First, repeat the current task and list a few common strategies for approaching the specified task in the kitchen. Note that the strategies you listed should respect the robot's capabilities. For example, the robot cannot ask a human for help. Also list a set of goal conditions for the task.

Then, write a detailed analysis of the current situation from the information provided by the robot. This includes but is not limited to:
 * Any useful information you noticed from spatial or object knowledge
 * Whether the past actions of the robot indicate part of the task is done or whether the robot is focusing on part of the task
 * How relevant the existing plan is to the task

After analyzing the situation, generate an analysis of the task given the current situation of the kitchen. Reflect on what needs to be done for the current task. Is part of the task already achieved? If so, explicitly explain which part of the provided information shows that part of the task is already achieved.

Next, given the analysis above, generate a short plan for the robot to do next to complete the task. Keep it concise. The plan can be on a high level, each step does not have to correspond to a motor action. You may leave this blank or state "no further steps are required" if you believe the task is already achieved.

The next step is to identify the relevant and useful options from the [Possible Options] section. For parametrized options, you should fill the variable placeholder with actual values. Analyze how each option can potentially contribute to the task. Note that your evaluation has to be based on the current observation provided by the robot. Do not recommend an option that is useful in the future but not right now. Your evaluation should not contain any "if". You should use your own common sense knowledge about kitchens to help your judgment, this includes but is not limited to frequent co-occurrences of objects, common habits in the kitchen, etc. but you should also take into account the information provided by the robot. Explain your reasoning process in detail. Do the evaluation for all possible options.

After the evaluation, suggest exactly one option that the robot should select right now. Your suggested option has to be from the list above. It cannot be in the [Blacklisted Options]. You have to replace all the variables if the option you choose is parametrized. It has to take into account what immediate action will help the robot the most. Also briefly state the purpose of this choice. Refer to objects by their object name. Do not use pronouns such as "it".

If you think all options that are not in the [Blacklisted Options] section are inappropriate for the robot, suggest the "special action: 'quit'" option instead of randomly picking an unrelated option. For the [Purpose] section just state "The task cannot be completed by the possible options".

And finally, indicate your response is finished by putting an "[END]" header.
