You are an expert in both Python and SOAR cognitive architecture. You are helping to develop code for a household robot that has a decision-making process similar to the SOAR cognitive architecture. Specifically, you will translate the English description of production rules into Python implementation of the production rule.

As a recap, a production rule has the form "IF ... THEN ..." where the IF part captures the preconditions of this production rule, and the THEN part leads to an action proposal.
Specifically for developing the robot, you will be completing the following code template for each production rule:
```py
class YourProduction: # TODO: replace the name with yours; letters only, no numbers

    target_task: str = ...  # define what kind of task this production is for, e.g. "place a/an <object> in/on a/an <receptacle>". If the production is not meant to be task-specific, set `target_task` to an empty string. Note that this is only for annotation purposes, you still have to test for the task in the `precondition` function below.

    def precondition(
        self, 
        current_task: str,
        current_location: str, # The object_name of the large receptacle that the robot is in front of (e.g. Fridge_12da98, Cabinet_d83acc, CounterTop4, etc.)
        previous_tasks: Dict[str, bool], # A dictionary that maps previously attempted tasks to their outcome. True means successful execution while False means otherwise. If a task is never attempted before then it will not be included in this dictionary
        spatial_knowledge: SpatialKnowledge, 
        object_knowledge: ObjectKnowledge,
    ) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        """
        Test if the precondition is met given the current information.
        Set variable bindings if necessary.
        This corresponds to the IF part of the production rule.
        Return (True, "") if the precondition is met.
        Otherwise, return (False, <reason for failure>) where the reason for failure should reflect which part of the precondition is not met.
        """
        # TODO: fill in your code here
        # you may use setattr(self, <key>, <value>) to set variables to hold actual objects from the environment.

    def apply(self) -> str:
        """
        Return the action if this production is applicable to the current state.
        This corresponds to the THEN part of the production rule.
        """
        # TODO: fill in your code here

    # you may also define your own helper functions
```

The following code snippet defines the components of spatial_knowledge and object_knowledge. You may use them in your code completion. You may also use any Python built-in functions and anything in the Python regex package (initialized by `import re`). Regex is very helpful when you want to generalize string matching in your production.
```py

    But spatial knowledge also includes information about the robot's gripper as the gripper is a special kind of receptacle

```

Additionally, you may use the following function to query whether a general statement is true. This might help express the preconditions that are beyond the robot's knowledge.
```py
def OracleQuery(statement: str) -> bool:
    """
    Return whether the input statement is true or false
    """
```
The statement you provided should be self-contained and its correctness should be independent from the current environment of the robot. You may use natural language for the statement you want to test.
Good example: "Eggs are commonly stored in the fridge"
Good example: "Lettuce is a kind of vegetable"
Bad example: "There is an egg in the fridge"
Bad example: "The robot's gripper is empty"
Bad example: "Where is Egg typically stored?"
Bad example: "How to make a sandwich"

Another helper function is defined to ensure consistent object name/type comparison. This is helpful if you want to check if a specific object fits the description.
```py
def name_equal(name1: str, name2: str) -> bool:
    """
    Return whether the two names are referring the same object
    """
```
Examples:
```
>>> name_equal("Drawer_13da9f", "drawer")
True
>>> name_equal("Knife_d9d12c", "Fork")
False
>>> name_equal("Cabinet", "cabinet")
True
>>> name_equal(obj.object_type, "apple") # returns whether the object is an apple
```

[Relevant Information]
 * The current task is to pick up and place a bread in a fridge.
 * The robot is currently holding the bread.
 * The robot is in front of the fridge.
 * The fridge is closed.

[Specific Rule]
IF the current task is to pick up and place a/an <object> in/on a/an <receptacle> AND the robot's gripper has the <object> AND the robot is at the <receptacle> AND the <receptacle> is closed THEN choose motor action: open <receptacle>.

[Generalizable Constants]
 * The <object> could be any object that the robot is required to place in a receptacle.
 * The <receptacle> could be any receptacle that the robot is required to place an object in.

[Generalized Rule]
IF the current task is to pick up and place a/an <object> in/on a/an <receptacle> AND the robot's gripper has the <object> AND the robot is at the <receptacle> AND the <receptacle> is closed THEN choose motor action: open <receptacle>.

[Correspondence]
 * <object> corresponds to the bread in the specific rule.
 * <receptacle> corresponds to the fridge in the specific rule.

Notes: This rule is applicable whenever the robot needs to place an object in a closed receptacle. It ensures that the robot will open the receptacle before attempting to place the object inside it.

----

Given the description above, generate the corresponding Python implementation for the [Generalized Rule] step by step:

First, analyze the [Relevant Information] and the IF part of the [Generalized Rule] and determine what variable bindings are needed. For each of the variables, identify how the value for the variable should be assigned (e.g. parsed from current_task, iterate through all receptacles, etc.) Additionally, state what constraint(s) should the value satisfy.

Next, for each of the preconditions, identify whether they are related to a variable. If so, list the variable(s) they are related to, and also state which attribute(s) of the variable is being constrained on. Pay attention to the implicit constraints. For example, "robot holding the target knife" constrains both the robot holding the target object, and the target object being a knife. Otherwise, state what part(s) are they concerned with (e.g. current task). Use the exact words from the [Generalized Rule] as names for each predicate, do not just say "the first predicate" or paraphrase.

Then, plan how to test for each of the constraints in the previous section. Which part of knowledge corresponds to each predicate in the preconditions?
As a reminder, you must not use direct string comparison (`==` or `!=`) when comparing object types, object names, or location names. Always use `name_compare` to avoid compatibility issues.

Finally, using all the information above, write the Python implementation by filling in the production rule template. Include all the variable bindings, preconditions, and effects. Comment your code properly.

As a reminder, all actions returned by the `effect` function of the productions should have one of the following prefixes.
 * motor action: ...
 * attend to subtask: ...
 * special action: ...

Also, set your `target_task` to pick up and place a/an <object> in/on a/an <receptacle>.

Use the following format:
[Variable Bindings]
 * name of variable 1: a brief description of what this variable is for. Its value should be assigned based on the current task.
 * name of variable 2: a brief description of variable 2. Its value should be assigned based on the current location. It has to be a ...
 * name of variable 3: a brief description of variable 3. Its value should be assigned by iterating through all receptacles and finding the receptacle that ...
 * ...

[Precondition Relation]
 * "predicate 1" is about the current task
 * "predicate 2" is about the object type of variable 1 and attribute 2 of variable 2
 * ...

[Precondition Test]
 * The robot's gripper is empty can be tested by checking if `spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting == []`
 * The target receptacle is opened can be tested by checking if `object_knowledge[spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle]].opened`
 * The target receptacle is not empty can be tested by checking if `spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle].hosting is not None and spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle].hosting != []`
 * "predicate 4" can be tested by iterating through all the receptacles and ...
 * ...

[Variable Bindings]
 * target_object: This variable is for the object that the robot is required to place in a receptacle. Its value should be parsed from the current task.
 * target_receptacle: This variable is for the receptacle that the robot is required to place an object in. Its value should be parsed from the current task.

[Precondition Relation]
 * "the current task is to pick up and place a/an <object> in/on a/an <receptacle>" is about the current task
 * "the robot's gripper has the <object>" is about the object type of target_object and the hosting attribute of the robot's gripper
 * "the robot is at the <receptacle>" is about the current location and the object name of target_receptacle
 * "the <receptacle> is closed" is about the opened attribute of target_receptacle

[Precondition Test]
 * The current task can be tested by checking if `current_task == f"pick up and place a/an {target_object} in/on a/an {target_receptacle}"`
 * The robot's gripper has the target object can be tested by checking if `target_object in spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"]`
 * The robot is at the target receptacle can be tested by checking if `name_equal(current_location, target_receptacle)`

AttributeError: 'OpenReceptacleBeforePlacing' object has no attribute 'target_receptacle'

You are going to debug this step-by-step, and generate a new implementation for the production.

First, reflect on what the returned message tells you about where the error is.

Next, identify what the error is.
Pay special attention to the following checklist:
 * Did you forget to use `name_equal` to compare location or object names?
 * Did you forget to set the variable bindings?
 * Is there a problem with how you generate variable bindings?
 * Is there a mismatch between your code and the provided interface? Is there something wrong with your preview response?

Then, explain what needs to be changed to your original code implementation.

Finally, generate a new implementation for the production above.

[Error Interpretation]
The message indicates that the attribute 'target_receptacle' is not found in the 'OpenReceptacleBeforePlacing' object. This error occurred in the `apply` function.

[Error Attribution]
The error is because the variable 'target_receptacle' is not an attribute of the 'OpenReceptacleBeforePlacing' object. It is a local variable in the `precondition` function and is not accessible in the `apply` function.

[Things to Change]
The 'target_receptacle' variable should be set as an attribute of the 'OpenReceptacleBeforePlacing' object in the `precondition` function. This way, it can be accessed in the `apply` function.
