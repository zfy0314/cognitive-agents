You are developing a household robot that runs the SOAR cognitive architecture to do some kitchen tasks. 

As a reminder, SOAR agents have a set of production rules that encodes what the robot should do in different scenarios. All productions are in the form of "IF ... THEN ..." where the IF part dictates when the production rule is applicable, and the THEN part proposes the action. All proposed action has to have one of the following prefixes: "motor action: ...", "attend to subtask: ...", "special action: ...". The proposed action should be a single, atomic action (i.e. no "if" allowed in the THEN part of the production). Keep in mind that rules are not themselves alternative actions, but instead units of context-dependent knowledge that contribute to making a decision and taking an action.

Hardware-wise the robot has an onboard camera that can perform object recognition. The camera is the robot's only perceptual sensor. The robot also has wheels to navigate around the kitchen. Additionally, it also has a gripper that can pick things up and put them down, open/close containers, or slice objects with a knife. It also knows how to turn on and off appliances such as a toaster.

Note that the robot only has one gripper. So if its gripper is occupied and the robot wants to pick up something else it would have to place the object currently in the gripper on some other receptacle first before picking up the new object. If objects are stacked (e.g. an apple is on a plate), then the robot can choose to pick the bottom object (i.e. plate) to have all of the stacked objects in its gripper.

Also, the gripper has limited range so if the robot wants to pick up some object it has to be in the same location of the object. Similarly, if the robot wants to put down some object in its gripper to a  receptacle, the robot has to be at the location of the target receptacle.

If the robot is holding a knife in its gripper and there is a sliceable object (e.g. a tomato) in its field of view, then the robot can slice that object with the knife. The robot can also crack an egg with a knife. However, if an object already has a "sliced" attribute in its [Object Knowledge], it means the object cannot be further sliced by the robot, and should be considered as already sliced.

Additionally, it can also perform two special actions to indicate termination:
 * 'done': From the observations and past information the robot is certain that the task has been successfully completed
 * 'quit': From the observations and past information the robot is certain that the task cannot be completed given the current environment

The robot has some learning capabilities that allow it to generate production rules from its past experience of interacting with the kitchen. However, the automatically generated production rules might be overly constrained, and/or not cover all cases. So your job is to analyze the existing production rules and improve them. However, do not suggest any changes to a production rule unless you are certain the new version is a reasonable generalization.

Task: find a/an <object>

Existing Production Rules:
 * IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot's gripper has <object> THEN choose special action: 'done'.
 * IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the <object> is located in <location> AND the robot is not at the location of the <object> AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose motor action: move to <location>.
 * IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the <object> is located in a/an <receptacle> AND the robot is in front of the <receptacle> AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose motor action: pick up <object>.
 * IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot is in front of a closed <receptacle> AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose motor action: open <receptacle>.
 * IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot's gripper is empty AND there are unexplored receptacles in the kitchen THEN choose 'attend to subtask: go to explore a/an <closest_unexplored_receptacle>'.
 * IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot's gripper is empty AND there is an unexplored <receptacle> that is commonly associated with the <object> THEN choose motor action: move to <receptacle>.

You will improve the production rules step by step.

First, based on your own understanding and the productions above, summarize the end condition of the task. 

Given the task, list some common cases of the task. What are the intermediate steps? What are the preconditions and post-conditions of the steps?

Then, for each production rule above, evaluate whether it is reasonable and whether it can be improved. Potential improvements could be removing unnecessary constraints, generalizing the components, and fixing logical errors. If you do not understand what the production rule is trying to achieve, propose to remove the production as it might cause an error for the robot. For each production rule, suggest one of the following:
 * keep it as is
 * remove it
 * change it to ...
As a reminder the possible action for each production is one of the following:
 * special action
   - 'done': to indicate the current task has been successfully completed
   - 'quit': to indicate the existing observation is sufficient to conclude that the task is impossible
 * motor action
   - move to location
   - open/close objects
   - toggle on/off appliance
   - pick up/put down objects
 * attend to subtask
   - find a/an <object>
   - go to explore a/an <receptacle>

Next, given the cases of the task and the existing productions, determine if there are scenarios that are not addressed by the existing productions. Briefly explain what cases might happen but cannot be handled by the existing production rules. If you believe the existing production rules are already exhaustive, clearly state so.

Finally, for each scenario you listed in the previous section (if any), propose a production rule for the robot to learn. The production rule you proposed should be in a similar format as the existing production rules.

Use the following format:

[Existing Productions]

[End Condition]
The task ends when the robot has found the object and has it in its gripper.

[Common Cases]
 * The object is in plain sight and the robot just needs to move to it and pick it up.
 * The object is inside a closed receptacle and the robot needs to open the receptacle before picking up the object.
 * The object is not in the robot's field of view and the robot needs to explore the kitchen to find it.

[Existing Productions]
 * "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot's gripper has <object> THEN choose special action: 'done'": This production is reasonable and covers the end condition of the task. No changes needed.
 * "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the <object> is located in <location> AND the robot is not at the location of the <object> AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose motor action: move to <location>": This production is reasonable but overly constrained because it only applies when the robot's gripper is empty. The robot can still move to the location of the object even if its gripper is not empty.
 Suggestion: change it to "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the <object> is located in <location> AND the robot is not at the location of the <object> THEN choose motor action: move to <location>".
 * "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the <object> is located in a/an <receptacle> AND the robot is in front of the <receptacle> AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose motor action: pick up <object>": This production is reasonable but overly constrained because it only applies when the robot's gripper is empty. The robot can still pick up the object even if its gripper is not empty, as long as it can place the object currently in its gripper somewhere else first.
 Suggestion: change it to "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the <object> is located in a/an <receptacle> AND the robot is in front of the <receptacle> THEN choose motor action: pick up <object>".
 * "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot is in front of a closed <receptacle> AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose motor action: open <receptacle>": This production is reasonable but overly constrained because it only applies when the robot's gripper is empty. The robot can still open the receptacle even if its gripper is not empty, as long as it can place the object currently in its gripper somewhere else first.
 Suggestion: change it to "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot is in front of a closed <receptacle> THEN choose motor action: open <receptacle>".
 * "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot's gripper is empty AND there are unexplored receptacles in the kitchen THEN choose 'attend to subtask: go to explore a/an <closest_unexplored_receptacle>'": This production is reasonable and covers the case where the robot needs to explore the kitchen to find the object. No changes needed.
 * "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot's gripper is empty AND there is an unexplored <receptacle> that is commonly associated with the <object> THEN choose motor action: move to <receptacle>": This production is reasonable but overly constrained because it only applies when the robot's gripper is empty. The robot can still move to the receptacle even if its gripper is not empty.
 Suggestion: change it to "IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND there is an unexplored <receptacle> that is commonly associated with the <object> THEN choose motor action: move to <receptacle>".

[Uncovered Cases]
 * Case1: The robot's gripper is occupied and it needs to pick up the object
   - The robot is at the location of the object
   - The robot's gripper is not empty
 * Case2: The robot's gripper is occupied and it needs to open a receptacle
   - The robot is in front of a closed receptacle
   - The robot's gripper is not empty

[New Production Rule]
 * IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the <object> is located in a/an <receptacle> AND the robot is in front of the <receptacle> AND the robot's gripper is not empty THEN choose motor action: put down <object_in_gripper> and pick up <object>.
 * IF the current task is to find a/an <object> AND the robot is in front of a closed <receptacle> AND the robot's gripper is not empty THEN choose motor action: put down <object_in_gripper> and open <receptacle>.
