You are developing a household robot that runs the SOAR cognitive architecture to do some kitchen tasks. 

As a reminder, SOAR agents have a set of production rules that encodes what the robot should do in different scenarios. All productions are in the form of "IF ... THEN ..." where the IF part dictates when the production rule is applicable, and the THEN part proposes the action. All proposed action has to have one of the following prefixes: "motor action: ...", "attend to subtask: ...", "special action: ...". The proposed action should be a single, atomic action (i.e. no "if" allowed in the THEN part of the production). Keep in mind that rules are not themselves alternative actions, but instead units of context-dependent knowledge that contribute to making a decision and taking an action.

Hardware-wise the robot has an onboard camera that can perform object recognition. The camera is the robot's only perceptual sensor. The robot also has wheels to navigate around the kitchen. Additionally, it also has a gripper that can pick things up and put them down, open/close containers, or slice objects with a knife. It also knows how to turn on and off appliances such as a toaster.

Note that the robot only has one gripper. So if its gripper is occupied and the robot wants to pick up something else it would have to place the object currently in the gripper on some other receptacle first before picking up the new object. If objects are stacked (e.g. an apple is on a plate), then the robot can choose to pick the bottom object (i.e. plate) to have all of the stacked objects in its gripper.

Also, the gripper has limited range so if the robot wants to pick up some object it has to be in the same location of the object. Similarly, if the robot wants to put down some object in its gripper to a  receptacle, the robot has to be at the location of the target receptacle.

If the robot is holding a knife in its gripper and there is a sliceable object (e.g. a tomato) in its field of view, then the robot can slice that object with the knife. The robot can also crack an egg with a knife. However, if an object already has a "sliced" attribute in its [Object Knowledge], it means the object cannot be further sliced by the robot, and should be considered as already sliced.

Additionally, it can also perform two special actions to indicate termination:
 * 'done': From the observations and past information the robot is certain that the task has been successfully completed
 * 'quit': From the observations and past information the robot is certain that the task cannot be completed given the current environment

The robot has some learning capabilities that allow it to generate production rules from its past experience of interacting with the kitchen. However, the automatically generated production rules might be overly constrained, and/or not cover all cases. So your job is to analyze the existing production rules and improve them. However, do not suggest any changes to a production rule unless you are certain the new version is a reasonable generalization.

Task: put things on the countertops away

Existing Production Rules:
 * IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND the robot's gripper is empty AND there are objects on the countertops AND there are empty cabinets THEN choose 'attend to subtask: pick up and place a/an <object_on_countertop> in/on a/an <empty_cabinet>'.
 * IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND the robot's gripper is empty AND there are unexplored countertops THEN choose 'attend to subtask: go to explore a/an <unexplored_countertop>'.
 * IF the current task is to clear objects from a/an <receptacle_type> AND all <receptacle_type> have been explored and are empty AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose special action: 'done'.
 * IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND the robot's gripper is empty AND the robot has already explored all the countertops AND there are unexplored cabinets THEN choose attend to subtask: go to explore a/an <unexplored_cabinet>.

You will improve the production rules step by step.

First, based on your own understanding and the productions above, summarize the end condition of the task. 

Given the task, list some common cases of the task. What are the intermediate steps? What are the preconditions and post-conditions of the steps?

Then, for each production rule above, evaluate whether it is reasonable and whether it can be improved. Potential improvements could be removing unnecessary constraints, generalizing the components, and fixing logical errors. If you do not understand what the production rule is trying to achieve, propose to remove the production as it might cause an error for the robot. For each production rule, suggest one of the following:
 * keep it as is
 * remove it
 * change it to ...
As a reminder the possible action for each production is one of the following:
 * special action
   - 'done': to indicate the current task has been successfully completed
   - 'quit': to indicate the existing observation is sufficient to conclude that the task is impossible
 * motor action
   - move to location
   - open/close objects
   - toggle on/off appliance
   - pick up/put down objects
 * attend to subtask
   - find a/an <object>
   - go to explore a/an <receptacle>
   - pick up and place a/an <object> in/on a/an <receptacle>
   - put things on the countertops away
   - slice a/an <sliceable>

Next, given the cases of the task and the existing productions, determine if there are scenarios that are not addressed by the existing productions. Briefly explain what cases might happen but cannot be handled by the existing production rules. If you believe the existing production rules are already exhaustive, clearly state so.

Finally, for each scenario you listed in the previous section (if any), propose a production rule for the robot to learn. The production rule you proposed should be in a similar format as the existing production rules.

Use the following format:

[Common Cases]

[Existing Productions]

[End Condition]
The task ends when all objects on the countertops have been put away in the cabinets and there are no more unexplored countertops or cabinets.

[Common Cases]
 * The robot's gripper is empty, and there are objects on the countertops and empty cabinets.
 * The robot's gripper is empty, and there are unexplored countertops.
 * All countertops have been explored and are empty, and the robot's gripper is empty.
 * The robot's gripper is empty, the robot has already explored all the countertops, and there are unexplored cabinets.

[Existing Productions]
 * "IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND the robot's gripper is empty AND there are objects on the countertops AND there are empty cabinets THEN choose 'attend to subtask: pick up and place a/an <object_on_countertop> in/on a/an <empty_cabinet>'": This production is reasonable and covers a common case. No changes are needed.
 * "IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND the robot's gripper is empty AND there are unexplored countertops THEN choose 'attend to subtask: go to explore a/an <unexplored_countertop>'": This production is reasonable and covers a common case. No changes are needed.
 * "IF the current task is to clear objects from a/an <receptacle_type> AND all <receptacle_type> have been explored and are empty AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose special action: 'done'": This production is reasonable but overly constrained because it only applies to a specific type of receptacle. Suggestion: change it to "IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND all countertops have been explored and are empty AND the robot's gripper is empty THEN choose special action: 'done'".
 * "IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND the robot's gripper is empty AND the robot has already explored all the countertops AND there are unexplored cabinets THEN choose attend to subtask: go to explore a/an <unexplored_cabinet>": This production is reasonable and covers a common case. No changes are needed.

[Uncovered Cases]
 * Case1: The robot's gripper is holding an object, and there are empty cabinets.
   - The robot's gripper is not empty
   - There are empty cabinets
 * Case2: The robot's gripper is holding an object, and there are no empty cabinets.
   - The robot's gripper is not empty
   - There are no empty cabinets

[New Production Rule]
 * IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND the robot's gripper is holding an object AND there are empty cabinets THEN choose 'attend to subtask: place a/an <object_in_gripper> in/on a/an <empty_cabinet>'.
 * IF the current task is to put things on the countertops away AND the robot's gripper is holding an object AND there are no empty cabinets THEN choose special action: 'quit'.
