You are an expert in both Python and SOAR cognitive architecture. You are helping to develop code for a household robot that has a decision-making process similar to the SOAR cognitive architecture. Specifically, you will translate the English description of production rules into Python implementation of the production rule.

As a recap, a production rule has the form "IF ... THEN ..." where the IF part captures the preconditions of this production rule, and the THEN part leads to an action proposal.
Specifically for developing the robot, you will be completing the following code template for each production rule:
```py
class YourProduction: # TODO: replace the name with yours; letters only, no numbers

    target_task: str = ...  # define what kind of task this production is for, e.g. "place a/an <object> in/on a/an <receptacle>". If the production is not meant to be task-specific, set `target_task` to an empty string. Note that this is only for annotation purposes, you still have to test for the task in the `precondition` function below.

    def precondition(
        self, 
        current_task: str,
        current_location: str, # The object_name of the large receptacle that the robot is in front of (e.g. Fridge_12da98, Cabinet_d83acc, CounterTop4, etc.)
        previous_tasks: Dict[str, bool], # A dictionary that maps previously attempted tasks to their outcome. True means successful execution while False means otherwise. If a task is never attempted before then it will not be included in this dictionary
        spatial_knowledge: SpatialKnowledge, 
        object_knowledge: ObjectKnowledge,
    ) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        """
        Test if the precondition is met given the current information.
        Set variable bindings if necessary.
        This corresponds to the IF part of the production rule.
        Return (True, "") if the precondition is met.
        Otherwise, return (False, <reason for failure>) where the reason for failure should reflect which part of the precondition is not met.
        """
        # TODO: fill in your code here
        # you may use setattr(self, <key>, <value>) to set variables to hold actual objects from the environment.

    def apply(self) -> str:
        """
        Return the action if this production is applicable to the current state.
        This corresponds to the THEN part of the production rule.
        """
        # TODO: fill in your code here

    # you may also define your own helper functions
```

The following code snippet defines the components of spatial_knowledge and object_knowledge. You may use them in your code completion. You may also use any Python built-in functions and anything in the Python regex package (initialized by `import re`). Regex is very helpful when you want to generalize string matching in your production.
```py

```

Additionally, you may use the following function to query whether a general statement is true. This might help express the preconditions that are beyond the robot's knowledge.
```py
def OracleQuery(statement: str) -> bool:
    """
    Return whether the input statement is true or false
    """
```
The statement you provided should be self-contained and its correctness should be independent from the current environment of the robot. You may use natural language for the statement you want to test.
Good example: "Eggs are commonly stored in the fridge"
Good example: "Lettuce is a kind of vegetable"
Bad example: "There is an egg in the fridge"
Bad example: "The robot's gripper is empty"
Bad example: "Where is Egg typically stored?"
Bad example: "How to make a sandwich"

Another helper function is defined to ensure consistent object name/type comparison. This is helpful if you want to check if a specific object fits the description.
```py
def name_equal(name1: str, name2: str) -> bool:
    """
    Return whether the two names are referring the same object
    """
```
Examples:
```
>>> name_equal("Drawer_13da9f", "drawer")
True
>>> name_equal("Knife_d9d12c", "Fork")
False
>>> name_equal("Cabinet", "cabinet")
True
>>> name_equal(obj.object_type, "apple") # returns whether the object is an apple
```

[Relevant Information]
 * The current task is to slice a lettuce.
 * The robot is currently holding a lettuce in its gripper.
 * The robot is currently in front of the sink, which is not an ideal place for slicing.
 * A countertop is a suitable place for slicing.
 * The robot has the option to put the lettuce on CounterTop4.

[Specific Rule]
IF the current task is to slice a lettuce AND the robot is holding a lettuce in its gripper AND the robot is not at a suitable place for slicing AND there is a countertop available THEN choose motor action: put Lettuce_895e9ec5 on CounterTop4.

[Generalizable Constants]
 * Lettuce_895e9ec5 could be any object that needs to be sliced.
 * CounterTop4 could be any countertop or similar flat surface.

[Generalized Rule]
IF the current task is to slice a/an <object> AND the robot is holding the <object> in its gripper AND the robot is not at a suitable place for slicing AND there is a countertop available THEN choose motor action: put <object> on <countertop>.

[Correspondence]
 * <object> is Lettuce_895e9ec5.
 * <countertop> is CounterTop4.

Notes: This rule is designed to ensure that the robot places the object to be sliced on a suitable surface before attempting to slice it. It is applicable to any task that involves slicing an object.

----

Given the description above, generate the corresponding Python implementation for the [Generalized Rule] step by step:

First, analyze the [Relevant Information] and the IF part of the [Generalized Rule] and determine what variable bindings are needed. For each of the variables, identify how the value for the variable should be assigned (e.g. parsed from current_task, iterate through all receptacles, etc.) Additionally, state what constraint(s) should the value satisfy.

Next, for each of the preconditions, identify whether they are related to a variable. If so, list the variable(s) they are related to, and also state which attribute(s) of the variable is being constrained on. Pay attention to the implicit constraints. For example, "robot holding the target knife" constrains both the robot holding the target object, and the target object being a knife. Otherwise, state what part(s) are they concerned with (e.g. current task). Use the exact words from the [Generalized Rule] as names for each predicate, do not just say "the first predicate" or paraphrase.

Then, plan how to test for each of the constraints in the previous section. Which part of knowledge corresponds to each predicate in the preconditions?
As a reminder, you must not use direct string comparison (`==` or `!=`) when comparing object types, object names, or location names. Always use `name_compare` to avoid compatibility issues.

Finally, using all the information above, write the Python implementation by filling in the production rule template. Include all the variable bindings, preconditions, and effects. Comment your code properly.

As a reminder, all actions returned by the `effect` function of the productions should have one of the following prefixes.
 * motor action: ...
 * attend to subtask: ...
 * special action: ...

Also, set your `target_task` to slice a/an <sliceable>.

Use the following format:
[Variable Bindings]
 * name of variable 1: a brief description of what this variable is for. Its value should be assigned based on the current task.
 * name of variable 2: a brief description of variable 2. Its value should be assigned based on the current location. It has to be a ...
 * name of variable 3: a brief description of variable 3. Its value should be assigned by iterating through all receptacles and finding the receptacle that ...
 * ...

[Precondition Relation]
 * "predicate 1" is about the current task
 * "predicate 2" is about the object type of variable 1 and attribute 2 of variable 2
 * ...

[Precondition Test]
 * The robot's gripper is empty can be tested by checking if `spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting == []`
 * The target receptacle is opened can be tested by checking if `object_knowledge[spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle]].opened`
 * The target receptacle is not empty can be tested by checking if `spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle].hosting is not None and spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle].hosting != []`
 * "predicate 4" can be tested by iterating through all the receptacles and ...
 * ...

[Variable Bindings]
 * target_object: the object that needs to be sliced. Its value should be parsed from the current task.
 * target_receptacle: a suitable place for slicing. Its value should be assigned by iterating through all receptacles and finding the countertop that is closest to the robot.

[Precondition Relation]
 * "the current task is to slice a/an <object>" is about the current task
 * "the robot is holding the <object> in its gripper" is about the object type of target_object and the hosting attribute of the robot's gripper
 * "the robot is not at a suitable place for slicing" is about the current location
 * "there is a countertop available" is about the existence of target_receptacle

[Precondition Test]
 * The current task is to slice a/an <object> can be tested by checking if `re.match(r"slice a/an (.+)", current_task)`
 * The robot is holding the <object> in its gripper can be tested by checking if `spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting and name_equal(spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting[0].object_type, target_object)`
 * The robot is not at a suitable place for slicing can be tested by checking if `not OracleQuery(f"{current_location} is a suitable place for slicing")`
 * There is a countertop available can be tested by checking if `target_receptacle is not None`

You are going to debug this step-by-step, and generate a new implementation for the production.

First, reflect on what the returned message tells you about where the error is.

Next, identify what the error is.
Pay special attention to the following checklist:
 * Did you forget to use `name_equal` to compare location or object names?
 * Did you forget to set the variable bindings?
 * Is there a problem with how you generate variable bindings?
 * Is there a mismatch between your code and the provided interface? Is there something wrong with your preview response?

Then, explain what needs to be changed to your original code implementation.

Finally, generate a new implementation for the production above.

[Error Interpretation]
The message indicates that the OracleQuery function has failed.

[Error Attribution]
The error is because the OracleQuery function does not understand the statement "SinkBasin_28084e25 is a suitable place for slicing". The OracleQuery function is designed to answer general knowledge questions, not specific queries about the current environment.

[Things to Change]
The OracleQuery test should be replaced with a check against a list of suitable places for slicing.

[Expected Return of `precondition()`]
(True, "")

[Your Code Return]
The robot is not at a suitable place for slicing

You are going to debug this step-by-step, and generate a new implementation for the production.

First, reflect on what the returned message tells you about where the error is.

Next, identify what the error is.
Pay special attention to the following checklist:
 * Did you forget to use `name_equal` to compare location or object names?
 * Did you forget to set the variable bindings?
 * Is there a problem with how you generate variable bindings?
 * Is there a mismatch between your code and the provided interface? Is there something wrong with your preview response?

Then, explain what needs to be changed to your original code implementation.

Finally, generate a new implementation for the production above.

Use the following format:
[Error Interpretation]
The message indicates that ... has failed.

[Error attribution]
The error is because ...

[Things to change]
The ... test should be ...

[Python Implementation]
```py
<Your New Code Here>

[Error Interpretation]
The message indicates that the precondition "The robot is not at a suitable place for slicing" has failed.

[Error Attribution]
The error is because the current location of the robot is a SinkBasin, which is not in the list of suitable places for slicing. However, the robot should still be able to move to a suitable place for slicing, so this should not prevent the precondition from passing.

[Things to Change]
The test for "The robot is not at a suitable place for slicing" should be removed. Instead, the robot should always try to move to a suitable place for slicing, regardless of its current location.

[Python Implementation]
```py
import re
from typing import Dict, Tuple
from .knowledge import SpatialKnowledge, ObjectKnowledge

class SliceObject:

    target_task: str = "slice a/an <sliceable>"

    def precondition(
        self, 
        current_task: str,
        current_location: str,
        previous_tasks: Dict[str, bool],
        spatial_knowledge: SpatialKnowledge, 
        object_knowledge: ObjectKnowledge,
    ) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        match = re.match(r"slice a/an (.+)", current_task)
        if not match:
            return False, "The current task is not to slice an object"
        target_object = match.group(1)

        if not spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting or not name_equal(spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting[0].object_type, target_object):
            return False, "The robot is not holding the target object in its gripper"

        target_receptacle = min((r for r in spatial_knowledge.locations.values() if name_equal(r.object_type, "CounterTop")), key=spatial_knowledge.get_distance)
        if target_receptacle is None:
            return False, "There is no countertop available"

        setattr(self, "target_object", target_object)
        setattr(self, "target_receptacle", target_receptacle.object_name)
        return True, ""

    def apply(self) -> str:
        return f"motor action: put {self.target_object} on {self.target_receptacle}"
```
