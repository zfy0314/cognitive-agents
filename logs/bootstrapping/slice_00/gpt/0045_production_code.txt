You are an expert in both Python and SOAR cognitive architecture. You are helping to develop code for a household robot that has a decision-making process similar to the SOAR cognitive architecture. Specifically, you will translate the English description of production rules into Python implementation of the production rule.

As a recap, a production rule has the form "IF ... THEN ..." where the IF part captures the preconditions of this production rule, and the THEN part leads to an action proposal.
Specifically for developing the robot, you will be completing the following code template for each production rule:
```py
class YourProduction: # TODO: replace the name with yours; letters only, no numbers

    target_task: str = ...  # define what kind of task this production is for, e.g. "place a/an <object> in/on a/an <receptacle>". If the production is not meant to be task-specific, set `target_task` to an empty string. Note that this is only for annotation purposes, you still have to test for the task in the `precondition` function below.

    def precondition(
        self, 
        current_task: str,
        current_location: str, # The object_name of the large receptacle that the robot is in front of (e.g. Fridge_12da98, Cabinet_d83acc, CounterTop4, etc.)
        previous_tasks: Dict[str, bool], # A dictionary that maps previously attempted tasks to their outcome. True means successful execution while False means otherwise. If a task is never attempted before then it will not be included in this dictionary
        spatial_knowledge: SpatialKnowledge, 
        object_knowledge: ObjectKnowledge,
    ) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        """
        Test if the precondition is met given the current information.
        Set variable bindings if necessary.
        This corresponds to the IF part of the production rule.
        Return (True, "") if the precondition is met.
        Otherwise, return (False, <reason for failure>) where the reason for failure should reflect which part of the precondition is not met.
        """
        # TODO: fill in your code here
        # you may use setattr(self, <key>, <value>) to set variables to hold actual objects from the environment.

    def apply(self) -> str:
        """
        Return the action if this production is applicable to the current state.
        This corresponds to the THEN part of the production rule.
        """
        # TODO: fill in your code here

    # you may also define your own helper functions
```

The following code snippet defines the components of spatial_knowledge and object_knowledge. You may use them in your code completion. You may also use any Python built-in functions and anything in the Python regex package (initialized by `import re`). Regex is very helpful when you want to generalize string matching in your production.
```py
# The following list defines the object types for large receptacles in the kitchen
list_of_large_receptacles = [
    "CounterTop",
    "Cabinet",
    "Drawer",
    "Fridge",
    "SinkBasin",

class Gripper(Receptacle):  # the robot's gripper is represented as a receptacle

class SpatialKnowledge:
    """

    But spatial knowledge also includes information about the robot's gripper as the gripper is a special kind of receptacle

    """

    def __getitem__(self, receptacle_name: str) -> Optional[Receptacle]:
        """

        """

    def get_distance(self, location: str) -> float:

        Return whether the robot knows anything about a specific object or object type. 
        Note that unexplored receptacles are not included in object knowledge and will return False.
        """
```

Additionally, you may use the following function to query whether a general statement is true. This might help express the preconditions that are beyond the robot's knowledge.
```py
def OracleQuery(statement: str) -> bool:
    """
    Return whether the input statement is true or false
    """
```
The statement you provided should be self-contained and its correctness should be independent from the current environment of the robot. You may use natural language for the statement you want to test.
Good example: "Eggs are commonly stored in the fridge"
Good example: "Lettuce is a kind of vegetable"
Bad example: "There is an egg in the fridge"
Bad example: "The robot's gripper is empty"
Bad example: "Where is Egg typically stored?"
Bad example: "How to make a sandwich"

Another helper function is defined to ensure consistent object name/type comparison. This is helpful if you want to check if a specific object fits the description.
```py
def name_equal(name1: str, name2: str) -> bool:
    """
    Return whether the two names are referring the same object
    """
```
Examples:
```
>>> name_equal("Drawer_13da9f", "drawer")
True
>>> name_equal("Knife_d9d12c", "Fork")
False
>>> name_equal("Cabinet", "cabinet")
True
>>> name_equal(obj.object_type, "apple") # returns whether the object is an apple
```

[Relevant Information]
 * The current task is to slice a lettuce.
 * The robot is currently holding a knife.
 * The lettuce is located on CounterTop2.
 * The robot is not currently at CounterTop2.

[Specific Rule]
IF the current task is to slice a lettuce AND the robot is holding a knife AND the lettuce is not at the robot's current location THEN choose motor action: move to CounterTop2.

[Generalizable Constants]
 * "Lettuce" could be any object that needs to be sliced.
 * "CounterTop2" could be any location that contains the object to be sliced.

[Generalized Rule]
IF the current task is to slice a/an <object> AND the robot is holding a knife AND the <object> is not at the robot's current location THEN choose motor action: move to <object_location>.

[Correspondence]
 * <object> is the lettuce in the specific rule.
 * <object_location> is CounterTop2 in the specific rule.

Notes: This rule is designed to guide the robot to the location of the object that needs to be sliced when it is already holding a knife. It is applicable to any task that involves slicing an object.

----

Given the description above, generate the corresponding Python implementation for the [Generalized Rule] step by step:

First, analyze the [Relevant Information] and the IF part of the [Generalized Rule] and determine what variable bindings are needed. For each of the variables, identify how the value for the variable should be assigned (e.g. parsed from current_task, iterate through all receptacles, etc.) Additionally, state what constraint(s) should the value satisfy.

Next, for each of the preconditions, identify whether they are related to a variable. If so, list the variable(s) they are related to, and also state which attribute(s) of the variable is being constrained on. Pay attention to the implicit constraints. For example, "robot holding the target knife" constrains both the robot holding the target object, and the target object being a knife. Otherwise, state what part(s) are they concerned with (e.g. current task). Use the exact words from the [Generalized Rule] as names for each predicate, do not just say "the first predicate" or paraphrase.

Then, plan how to test for each of the constraints in the previous section. Which part of knowledge corresponds to each predicate in the preconditions?
As a reminder, you must not use direct string comparison (`==` or `!=`) when comparing object types, object names, or location names. Always use `name_compare` to avoid compatibility issues.

Finally, using all the information above, write the Python implementation by filling in the production rule template. Include all the variable bindings, preconditions, and effects. Comment your code properly.

As a reminder, all actions returned by the `effect` function of the productions should have one of the following prefixes.
 * motor action: ...
 * attend to subtask: ...
 * special action: ...

Also, set your `target_task` to slice a/an <sliceable>.

Use the following format:
[Variable Bindings]
 * name of variable 1: a brief description of what this variable is for. Its value should be assigned based on the current task.
 * name of variable 2: a brief description of variable 2. Its value should be assigned based on the current location. It has to be a ...
 * name of variable 3: a brief description of variable 3. Its value should be assigned by iterating through all receptacles and finding the receptacle that ...
 * ...

[Precondition Relation]
 * "predicate 1" is about the current task
 * "predicate 2" is about the object type of variable 1 and attribute 2 of variable 2
 * ...

[Precondition Test]
 * The robot's gripper is empty can be tested by checking if `spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting == []`
 * The target receptacle is opened can be tested by checking if `object_knowledge[spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle]].opened`
 * The target receptacle is not empty can be tested by checking if `spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle].hosting is not None and spatial_knowledge[target_receptacle].hosting != []`
 * "predicate 4" can be tested by iterating through all the receptacles and ...
 * ...

[Python Implementation]
```py
<Your Code Here>
```

[Variable Bindings]
 * target_object: the object that needs to be sliced. Its value should be parsed from the current task.
 * target_location: the location of the target object. Its value should be assigned by looking up the location of the target object in the object knowledge.

[Precondition Relation]
 * "the current task is to slice a/an <object>" is about the current task
 * "the robot is holding a knife" is about the object type of the object in the robot's gripper
 * "the <object> is not at the robot's current location" is about the location of the target object and the current location of the robot

[Precondition Test]
 * The current task is to slice a/an <object> can be tested by checking if `current_task.startswith("slice a/an ")`
 * The robot is holding a knife can be tested by checking if `spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting is not None and spatial_knowledge["RobotGripper"].hosting[0].object_type == "Knife"`
 * The <object> is not at the robot's current location can be tested by checking if `target_location != current_location`
